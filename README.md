This application serves to create a better sense of security for password keeping.
This application is to include a responsive page that gives the user critera for
a password as well as generating one for the user. The user is first prompted with a question
about how many charectors they want their password to include. After the question is
answered the user must select if they want upper case letters, lower case letter, numbers and/or special charectors. Once all the questions are completed, the user is given a password that meets the critera from their responses.
